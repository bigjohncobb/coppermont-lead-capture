# Coppermont Lead Capture

Coppermont Lead Capture is a lightweight WordPress plugin for lead generation using a bottom slide-in infobar and shortcode embeds.

## Features

- Bottom infobar email capture module with slide-in animation.
- Trigger support:
  - Scroll percentage trigger.
  - Time-delay trigger.
  - Exit-intent trigger.
- Targeting support:
  - Page-level include/exclude targeting.
  - Referral detection (allow-list domains).
  - Time scheduler window (start/end).
- Repetition control:
  - Max views per visitor.
  - Cooldown after dismiss.
- Analytics:

  - Submission count.
- Shortcode support:

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to `wp-content/plugins/coppermont-lead-capture`.
2. Activate **Coppermont Lead Capture** from **Plugins**.
3. Configure options in **Settings > Lead Capture**.

## Shortcode

```text
[coppermont_infobar]
[coppermont_infobar headline="Get updates" body="Join our list" button="Subscribe"]
```

## Security Notes

- Direct file access is blocked in PHP entry files with `ABSPATH` checks.
- AJAX handlers enforce nonce verification.
- User input is sanitized server-side before persistence.
- Admin settings rendering is protected by capability checks (`manage_options`).

## Uninstall Behavior

Data lifecycle is admin-controlled via **Settings → Lead Capture → Keep Data on Uninstall** (enabled by default).

- **Enabled (default):** uninstall keeps all plugin-owned data.
- **Disabled:** uninstall permanently purges all plugin-owned data managed by the data manager, including plugin options, plugin transients, and plugin custom database tables (including future entities registered through data-manager hooks).

## Extensibility

On successful lead submission, the plugin fires:

- `cmlc_lead_submitted( string $email, array $settings )`

Use this action to forward leads to CRM or email marketing tools.

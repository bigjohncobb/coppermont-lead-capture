## Security Notes

- Direct file access is blocked in PHP entry files with `ABSPATH` checks.
- AJAX handlers enforce nonce verification.
- User input is sanitized server-side before persistence.
- Admin settings rendering is protected by capability checks (`manage_options`).

## Uninstall Behavior

The plugin includes `uninstall.php` and removes the `cmlc_settings` option when uninstalled via WordPress.

## Extensibility

On successful lead submission, the plugin fires:

Use this action to forward leads to CRM or email marketing tools.

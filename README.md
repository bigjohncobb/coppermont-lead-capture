# Coppermont Lead Capture

Coppermont Lead Capture is a lightweight WordPress plugin for lead generation using a bottom slide-in infobar and shortcode embeds.

## Features

- Bottom infobar email capture module with slide-in animation.
- Trigger support:
  - Scroll percentage trigger.
  - Time-delay trigger.
  - Exit-intent trigger.
- Targeting support:
  - Page-level include/exclude targeting.
  - Referral detection (allow-list domains).
  - Time scheduler window (start/end).

  - Max views per visitor.
  - Cooldown after dismiss.

  - Submission count.
- Shortcode support:

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to `wp-content/plugins/coppermont-lead-capture`.
2. Activate **Coppermont Lead Capture** from **Plugins**.
3. Configure options in **Settings > Lead Capture**.

## Shortcode

```text
[coppermont_infobar]
[coppermont_infobar headline="Get updates" body="Join our list" button="Subscribe"]
```

## Security Notes

- Direct file access is blocked in PHP entry files with `ABSPATH` checks.
- AJAX handlers enforce nonce verification.
- User input is sanitized server-side before persistence.
- Admin settings rendering is protected by capability checks (`manage_options`).

## Uninstall Behavior

By default, the plugin **keeps data on uninstall** to prevent accidental data loss.

- Setting: `Keep plugin data when uninstalling` in **Settings > Lead Capture > Data & Privacy**
- Default: Enabled (`keep_data_on_uninstall = 1`)
- If enabled: uninstall exits early and preserves plugin data
- If disabled: uninstall performs full cleanup and removes plugin-owned data (options, plugin tables, campaign CPT content, plugin transients, and plugin cron hooks).

If you want a full cleanup, disable the setting first, save changes, and then uninstall the plugin.

## Extensibility

On successful lead submission, the plugin fires:

- `cmlc_lead_submitted( string $email, array $settings )`

Use this action to forward leads to CRM or email marketing tools.
